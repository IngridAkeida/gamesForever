## About The Project 
<p>
This is the project where I was able to apply the knowledge acquired during the Fundamentals in the FrontEnd Developer course at <a href="https://www.hyperisland.com/">Hyper Island</a>. 
The project brief was to create a 90's website with HTML and CSS, responsive, fluid sizes, and with good development practices. I believe that I can achieve the aspects highlighted in the Brief. Furthermore, I feel that I achieved my personal goals for this project and learned a lot during the construction of it.
</p>

<p> I really like the Nintendo gaming universe 🍄🐢🎮, so my inspiration for this project was about the universe and colors of the Mario Bros world and others Nintendo Games.</p>
